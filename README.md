### Hello, I'm Shreeya Nikkamüëã

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### **BOOKSHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**OVERVIEW:**
1.Inventory Management
Book Database The system maintains a comprehensive database of books, including details such as title, author, ISBN, price, genre, and stock levels. This database can be efficiently managed using data structures like Hash Tables or Trie for quick
lookups and updates.
2.Stock Management
The system utilizes data structures like Heaps to track stock levels and identify low-stock items,
allowing the bookshop to replenish inventory effectively and avoid stockouts.
3.Searching and Filtering
Efficient search functionalities are implemented using Trie for auto-completion and Hash
Tables for quick book lookups, enabling customers to easily find their desired books based on various attributes.
4.Stock Replenishment 
The system optimizes stock replenishment by analyzing sales trends and predicting demand using
algorithms like Dynamic Programming, ensuring that the right books are ordered at the right time.

**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:**

1. Improved Efficiency and Productivity
Automates tasks such as inventory management, sales tracking, and order processing, reducing the time required for manual processes.
Staff can focus on customer service and other high-priority tasks.
2. Enhanced Inventory Management
Tracks stock levels in real time, reducing instances of overstocking or understocking.
Identifies popular books and seasonal trends, allowing better decision-making regarding restocking and promotions.
3. Better Customer Experience
